About SmallSharpTools
=====================

SmallSharpTools is my software development and consulting business. 
Under this account on GitHub are primarily private repoistories. My
publicly available repositories are available under (brennanMKE)[https://github.com/brennanMKE].
I also have a (portfolio)[http://brennanmke.github.com/Portfolio/] available 
to show my client work along with my main Open Source projects.
