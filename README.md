About SmallSharpTools
=====================

SmallSharpTools is my software development and consulting business. 
This GitHub account is mostly private repoistories. Most of my
publicly available repositories are available under my personal account, [brennanMKE](https://github.com/brennanMKE).
I also have a [portfolio](http://brennanmke.github.com/Portfolio/) available 
to show my client work along with my main Open Source projects.
